# Flask-app
Making web apps using Flask.  
For our database, we used the SQLite relational DB to store our data in the form of tables.  
Now for our application, we are going to split the code into 3 parts:   
- app.py — the entry & exit point to our application  
- service.py — converts the request into a response.  
- models.py — handles everything that involves a Database.  
Only the backend is created in this project.
